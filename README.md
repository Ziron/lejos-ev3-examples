# lejos-ev3-examples
Example code for programming the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 in Java with LeJOS.

The file EV3Skeleton.java contains a code skeleton which creates the robot with motors and sensors, 
along with some wrapper classes for the sensors to make them easier to use.

Either copy the EV3Skeleton and add your own code in its main function.
Or make a new class that extends EV3Skeleton and copy the code of the main function into that class,
as all of the examples does.
